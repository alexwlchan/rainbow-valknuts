# rainbow-valknuts

This is a tiny web app for generating rainbow [valknuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valknut), based on an idea in [a tweet by @KlezmerGryphon](https://twitter.com/KlezmerGryphon/status/1173897515843735553):

It uses some code I wrote last year for [drawing with triangular coordinates in SVG](https://alexwlchan.net/2019/09/triangular-coordinates-in-svg/), then randomly selects three flags to mash up into an image.

The flag definitions are taken from the [QueerJS website](https://queerjs.com/flags).
